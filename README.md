# Hi I'm Nunzio Sabino 👋

This repo helps people find my work. Use the links below to view my full portfolio.

- Portfolio page (GitHub Pages): https://nunziosabino.github.io/  <!-- update if you choose a different repo name -->
- GitHub profile: https://github.com/NunzioSabino

How I organize my work
- /projects/ — project files (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX). Files placed here are listed and downloadable from the Pages site.
- /repos/ — (optional) link to source code repositories for each project (use pinned repositories on your profile for visibility).
- Use clear file names and short descriptions so visitors can quickly find the right file.

Notes & tips
- GitHub file limit: individual files must be under 100 MB (use Releases or external hosting for bigger files).
- Keep the repo public if you want everyone to access your files via the Pages site.
- To make files easier to browse, add a short README.md inside /projects/ describing each file or subfolder.
